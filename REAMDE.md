# Exploratory analysis of the database from National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration

This document explores the damages to property and crops as well as loss of life and injuries, due to natural disasters. The period in question is 1996-2014. All the dollar damages are CPI adjusted using data from Quandl. CPI and NOAA data is updated automatically by the script, hence the report needs to be recompiled in order to the the most up-to-date results.
